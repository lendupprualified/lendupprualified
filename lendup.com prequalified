A two week delay from the IRS will surely create a need for direct payday loan lender help, especially when it comes to handling holiday debt. The IRS is often a predictable source of cash for many households. A return is anxiously awaited to help recover from holiday shopping sprees, pay down other debt, set aside for property taxes or a fast refill for a drained emergency savings account. This year, the IRS pushed back the tax year start date. Many households will have to wait a few extra weeks before getting their return.

For those people who depend on their tax return as a way for January finances to to balance. Trouble is ahead. With holiday debt looming amidst the budget, credit cards will often not be able to support any extra costs. Direct payday lenders help when borrowers do not have the necessary funds to make on-time payments and incoming money is still a week or two away. Most often, these fast payday advances are used between paychecks and they don't discriminate towards any type of emergency help. The whole idea behind a short-term loan is to get fast money to cover emergencies. Having to wait a few extra weeks for a tax return is an emergency for some.
